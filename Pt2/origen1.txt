There's a lady who's sure
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
If the stores are all closed
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven
But she wants to be sure
In a tree by the brook
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving
Ooh, it makes me wonder
When I look to the west
In my thoughts I have seen
And the voices of those who standing looking
Ooh, it really makes me wonder
Then the piper will lead us to reason
For those who stand long
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
But in the long run
And it makes me wonder
