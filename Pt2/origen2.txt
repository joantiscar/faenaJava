All that glitters is gold
When she gets there she knows
With a word she can get what she came for
There's a sign on the wall
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
There's a songbird who sings
Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get
And my spirit is crying for leaving
Rings of smoke through the trees
Ooh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
And a new day will dawn
And the forests will echo with laughter
Don't be alarmed now
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
There's still time to change the road you're on
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
